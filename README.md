## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Browse the folders** organized by topic (Basics, Functions, DOM, etc.)
2. **Read the code examples** with detailed comments
3. **Run the files** in Node.js or a browser console
4. **Experiment & modify** the code to deepen your understanding

```bash
# To run any JavaScript file:
node 01_Basics/01_variables.js
```

## 🎯 Introduction

JavaScript is an essential language for creating interactive websites and building modern web applications. As I learn, I’m exploring everything from the basics of variables and functions to more dynamic topics like event handling and asynchronous programming. My goal is to build a solid foundation that will allow me to create fun projects and eventually contribute to real-world applications.

## 📚 Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundations (Current) 🔥

Master the core building blocks of JavaScript:

| Topic                  | Files                                             | Status         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Variables & Data Types | `01_variables.js`, `02_DataTypes.js`              | 📚 In Progress |
| Operators & Conversion | `03_conversionOperations.js`, `04_comparision.js` | 📚 In Progress |
| Control Flow           | Coming Soon                                       | ⏳ Upcoming    |
| Functions              | Coming Soon                                       | ⏳ Upcoming    |

### Phase 2: Intermediate 📖

- Scope & Closures
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Array & String Methods

### Phase 3: Advanced 🚀

- Asynchronous JavaScript
- DOM & Events
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+)

## ✍️ Sample Code

Here’s a simple example to get you started. This code shows a basic function and a loop:

```javascript
// Greet the user by name
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to my JavaScript journey.`;
}

console.log(greet("Anup"));
```
